# New Desk Template

Lately, I've been enjoying writing apps that serve their frontend directly with Sail.

This template provides all the libraries and facilities necessary to bootstrap an app like this. 

In /lib/view-template.hoon, you'll find a constant `marl` with script tags to source the javascript libraries I like to use from CDN. 

That's it. No build step, no glob, no bundler, no transpilation. Just fast, fun, powerful UI. Hope you enjoy.
